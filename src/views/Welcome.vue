            <p>
              ORFanID is a web-based software engine that identifies ORFan genes
              from the genomes of specified species or from a given list of DNA
              sequences. The scope of the search for orphan genes can be defined
              by the selection of the taxonomy level of interest. Detectable
              homologous sequences are found for candidate gene in the NCBI
              databases. From these findings the ORFanID engine identifies and
              depicts orphan genes. Results may be viewed and analyzed
              graphically for the purpose of scientific research and inquiry.

              <p>
                Orphan genes (also known as taxonomically restricted genes) are
                genes that do not have related ancestral genes in other species
                or at the specified taxonomy level. At the molecular level,
                ORFan genes consist of DNA sequences that have no homology with
                sequences found in common DNA databases such as Genbank. While
                the prevailing dogma has defined genes in different species as a
                result of gene duplication or recombination, the presence of
                orphan gene ubiquity in various sequenced genomes is a mystery,
                perhaps even a significant problem to be solved.

              <p>
                Historically, gene function is known to be expressed through
                proteins. There are specific organisms that have been
                <strong>found </strong>with unique proteins expressed by orphan
                genes such as Hydra, various Mollusks, Salamander and others. It
                appears that the anatomy of Hydra is mediated by orphan genes
                that give rise to unique proteins. Similarly, the mantle of
                various Mollusks has been found to be expressed from orphan
                genes, while the regeration of salamander limbs are mediated by
                orphans (Dr. Paul Nelson, 2017)

              <p>
                By identifying these unique DNA sequences, ORFanID can help
                discover the origin, function and other significance of orphan
                genes. The software is able to identify genes unique to genus,
                family, or species etc. at differing taxonomy levels. Based on
                the parameters specified, some of orphans (also called Taxonomy
                Restricted Genes) may or may not fall under the given
                classification for strict ORFans. &nbsp; As such, ORFanID can
                help delineate the actual sequence and function of
                <em>de novo</em> genes discovered in species and at all levels
                of the taxonomy tree.
